## Lychrel Number Analyzer â€” The 196 Problem

Parallelized Python application for identifying Lychrel number candidates using the reverse-and-add algorithm. Includes a Flask frontend, SQLite database logging, and MIDI music generation from numeric sequences.

---

## Overview

This project explores the mysterious behavior of **Lychrel numbers** â€” numbers that seemingly never become palindromes under the reverse-and-add procedure. Inspired by the infamous case of **196**, 
this tool allows large-scale testing and data analysis on number intervals using multiprocessing.

It also offers:
- A high-precision reverse-and-add engine
- A Flask web interface to run and visualize tests
- SQLite storage of results with stats
- MIDI music generation based on the digits in reverse-add sequences

## What Is a Lychrel Number?

A number is a **Lychrel candidate** if it fails to produce a palindrome after many iterations of:

```
n â†’ n + reverse(n)
Example:

89 â†’ 187 â†’ 968 â†’ ... â†’ 8813200023188 (palindrome after 24 steps)
But some numbers (like 196) have been tested for millions of steps with no palindrome found.

Features
Feature	Description
 - Reverse-and-add	Digit-by-digit simulation for full control over big numbers
 - Multiprocessing	Full CPU core utilization with Python's multiprocessing module
 - SQLite logging	Stores convergence data, iterations, palindromes, and timestamps
 - Flask frontend	Enter start/end values in the browser and get structured JSON results
 - MIDI output	Converts digit sequences into jazz-style MIDI music (force_end.py)
 - Academic context	Full explanation available in Problema numerelor Lychrel.pdf

```

## Running the Project
1. Install Dependencies

pip install flask midiutil

2. Run from Command Line

python 196.py

You'll be prompted to enter a range. Output will be saved to:

history.txt â€” all possible Lychrel candidates

history.db â€” all numbers that converged to palindromes

3. Run the Web App

python app.py
Go to http://localhost:5000
Youâ€™ll get a UI to input a numeric range and receive results via a clean JSON API, including:

Lychrel candidates

Palindromes and how many steps they took

Grouped final palindromes

4. Generate Music from Digits
python force_end.py
Creates a jazz-style MIDI file from the digit sequence generated by applying the algorithm to 196.

Default output:

lychrel_196_jazz_with_swing_drums.mid


Sample Output

89 â†’ 8813200023188 in 24 steps
98 â†’ 8813200023188 in 24 steps
196 â†’ could be a possible Lychrel number (tested 1000 iterations)

Research Source
This project is based on the academic paper included:

Problema numerelor Lychrel.pdf

It includes:

History of the 196 problem

Parallelism and algorithmic design

Statistical analysis

Delayed palindromes and trajectory visualization

Open questions in number theory

## Future Enhancements:

 Add matplotlib graphs to visualize iteration distributions

 Optimize detection by skipping known trajectory numbers

 Apply ML to classify Lychrel-like numbers

 Extend to other numeric bases (binary, base 12, etc.)
